# cpsc3600ChatProject

## About
This project was an open-ended project for my Network Systems class. The project is a chat room server that includes a client software that runs a minimalist GUI. Multiple clients can be connected to the server and messages sent from a client show up on the other clients. The server is multithreaded to accomplish this.

This project is written in C and GTK was used to provide a GUI. The program is only tested on Fedora, but other Linux distributions should work if GTK 4.0 was installed.
